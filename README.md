# Steganography
A Free time project to create a steganography software that will encode passwords into images. 

15/02-
Creating this repo with a simple prototype I created a few days ago - not complext at all but mostly for me to keep track on how to use opencv.

Aims:
Not lost my C++ Skills.
Remind me how to operate with opencv as well as explore it a bit deeper.
Maybe create a visual Gui for it.
